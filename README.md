> # myCaps - CapsLock Remap Emulator

Today I get up and choose violence 😁😁

How often do you guys use your CapsLock? Not much right. I think its in the perfect position but its not giving the functionality it should give. So what did I do as a fellow programmer? I mapped it to more useful keys. Buckle up this is gonna be hard to accept😂😂.

Just hold CapsLock with your left hand pinky finger and see the magic happen.

- CapsLock + a -> Ctrl + a (Select all)
- CapsLock + s -> Ctrl + x (Cut)
- CapsLock + d -> Ctrl + c (Copy)
- CapsLock + f -> Ctrl + v (Paste)

> See ☝🏿, [a,s,d,f] are the keys that your left hand rests on when you are touch typing. So I mapped them to the keys that a programmer needs most 🤣🤣.

- CapsLock + j -> Left Arrow
- CapsLock + k -> Down Arrow
- CapsLock + l -> Right Arrow
- CapsLock + i -> Up Arrow

> See ☝🏿, [j,k,l] are the keys that your right hand rests on when you are touch typing. So I mapped them to the arrow keys. This is way more efficient than using the arrow keys with your right hand.

- CapsLock + n -> Backspace
- CapsLock + m -> Delete

> See ☝🏿, [n,m] are the keys you can easily reach with your right hand index finger. So I reach Backspace and Delete with my right hand. right?

CapsLock + ,  -> Ctrl + z (Undo)
CapsLock + .  -> Ctrl + y (Redo)

> See ☝🏿, [,.] are the keys you can easily reach with your right hand middle finger. So no more Ctrl + z and Ctrl + y. I reach Undo and Redo with my right hand.
